The objective of the study was to extract the features from the speech wave. The speech also reflects the mood of the person and their emotional condition while talking. 
For example, when our favorite team is the winning game, and a friend calls us, generally we talk with a friend with excitement in our tone. Similarly, if you had a fight with your boyfriend in the morning, your tone or a conversation with a cab driver could be angry or sad (based on your emotional condition). 

In this experiment, we have shown the practical implementation of the feature extraction from the speech signals. 

Here, we have not explained on How the audio signal forms, or steps of the MFCC like what is pre-emphasis and  Mel-filter, etc. Many studies ard articles are available on this, one can refer to the internet or you can learn from - here. 

Kindly note, apart from MFCC there are many other techniques to do the feature extraction from an audio signal like Linear prediction coefficient (LPC), Discrete wavelet transform (DWT), etc.

The project can be implemented in business perspectives like, 

##### Telecallers: which person in a team is more effective and why! Can we identify parameters (like tone, time of conversation, the prospect interaction, etc) from the best telecallers to train junior telecallers! 

##### Sales: Better and right sales call analysis, this can be done with the use of NLP and speech analysis. Which salesman talks about what? with which emotions and which tone? What were the client's reactions and tone? These and many more parameters can help a company to fine-tune their salespeople. 

##### Recruitment: With the help of past interview data, and the current best performing resources can lead firms to handpick the brightest mind in the future. Generally, interviewers phrases, that it took less than 2–4 minutes of initial interaction to decide whether the interviewee is fit for the company or not. That again the interviewer decides from their long interviewing experience and person's way of talking and their confidence and emotions while talking.
